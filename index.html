        <div class="subheading mb-5">Biochemistry Major</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a third year Biochemistry Major with Medical Sciences concentration.  I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam and immigrated to Los Angeles, California in 2010.  Growing up in Los Angeles, my English was not great.  It took me about 3 years of reading Harry Potter books in the library before I built up courage to speak to other students.  After I gained more confidence with my English, I became my family’s translator for the majority of things including doctor visits.  During one of the doctor visits, I found out that my mom had a heart condition that cannot be treated.  After numerous visits with the doctor, I was able to gather more information on the condition which sparked my interest in the medical field.<br><br>

        No matter what position I strive for in the medical field, it will still require hard work, dedication, and a high level tenacity.  It requires four years of undergraduate school, two years of some form of graduate or professional school, and at least six more years of actual working to gain experience if I want to get into a specialty.  Although it requires so much work, I actually did not want to go to college at first.  After talking to multiple teachers from my high school, I applied and was given a chance when I was accepted into the University of California, Riverside (UCR).  I came into the College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences as an Undeclared and was in a Learning Community full of other students who were aspiring physician assistants, nurses, and doctors.  I was and never have been confident with my studies.  I never gave my all during any of my studies from middle school and throughout high school.  It was a miracle that I got accepted into the university of california, Riverside so I really wanted to try my best.  However, college is incredibly different from high school work.  I was able to get As easily if I put in a minor amount of work, but in college, I would barely be able to get a B+ even after putting my all into studying.<br><br>

        Other than high grades, a medical school application also requires the person to have extra curriculars, hours of volunteering or shadowing at a clinic, and a high score on the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT).  Normally, many people do start to prepare for the test during their second year of college so that they can take the test in their third year and prepare their application because it is almost a two years process.  I have recently signed up to take the MCAT test this upcoming August and will be preparing for the test starting this quarter.  I am also going through a program called COPE.  It gives me a chance to go cycle through different floors of the hospital to learn more about each specialty and have actual patient and staff interactions.  This way, I will be able to learn from multiple medical field staff from nurses to physician assistants to many different types of doctors.
